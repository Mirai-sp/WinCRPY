# WinCRPY

WinCRPY is an application that uses the AES encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt files or texts.

The tool is useful for keeping files stored more securely or generating encrypted texts to be saved on the disk and stored more securely.

There is no guarantee that the implementation is robust and completely secure, so use at your own risk.
